# HDB_examples
Example sketches for smart heads development for the FABtotum

This repository contains Arduino sketches that can be run on a Arduino Nano or similar development boards mounted on the FABtotum Personal Fabricator through a HDB.

All sketches require the latest development version of FABlin. You can compile it yourself from [source](https://github.com/FABtotum/FABlin/tree/development) or flash the precompiled hex file given in this repository.

For general pointers on the Head Development Kit, and the accompanying Head Development Board (HDB), see: http://www.fabtotum.com/head-development-guidelines
